Problems
    - code duplication
    - closed for extension
    - reusability, maintainability

Improvements
    - isolate change
    - separate different levels of abstraction
    - open for extension
    - higher level abstractions do not depend on lower level
    - stability


Notes
    - abstract common behaviour
    - no hardcoded lists in function
    - commit to a specific impl alap
    - open to add more configs but closed for modification
    - tuple for errors
    - functional style
